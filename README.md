An intelligent full-stack web application that modernizes the second-hand goods trading ecosystem using **Machine Learning**, ensuring **fair pricing**, **fraud prevention**, and **trustworthy transactions** while promoting sustainability and the circular economy.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **ML Powered Second-Hand Trading Platform** is designed to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers of second-hand items.  
It leverages machine learning models to provide **price prediction**, **image-based product search**, **fake logo verification**, and **personalized recommendations**.

This platform helps users:
- Get **fair price suggestions**
- Avoid **counterfeit products**
- Find similar items using images
- Trade second-hand items securely and efficiently

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Traditional second-hand markets face:

- ❌ Lack of price transparency  
- ❌ No fraud detection mechanisms  
- ❌ Informal and unsafe transactions  
- ❌ Limited product discovery  

This platform solves these problems using intelligent ML pipelines and secure web architecture.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshitgarg1/ML-Powered-Scrap-Trading-Platform.git
cd ML-Powered-Scrap-Trading-Platform
```
### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup
```text
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Backend Setup
```text
cd server
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 🔐 Firebase Admin Setup (Required for Escrow)

- Generate Firebase Service Account Key
- Place it inside:
```bash
server/serviceAccountKey.json
```
- Update databaseURL in app.py
- Run:
```text
python app.py
```
- ⚠️ serviceAccountKey.json is ignored via .gitignore.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables
```text
Create a .env file in both client and server folders for sensitive keys:

FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```
---

## 📦 ML Models & Datasets

- Large ML models are intentionally excluded.
- Models are stored locally or in cloud storage.
- Keeps repository lightweight and collaboration-friendly.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Firebase role-based authentication
- Protected API routes
- Environment variable isolation
- No sensitive keys in repository

---

## 🔒 Escrow V2 Architecture (escrow-v2 Branch)

- The escrow-v2 branch introduces a production-grade escrow system designed with:

-- 🔁 Atomic Firebase Transactions

-- 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (Buyer / Seller / Admin / System)

-- 📊 Multi-State Synchronization (escrow_status, payment_status, shipment_status)

-- ⏳ Auto-Refund (Shipping Timeout)

-- ⏳ Auto-Release (Delivery Confirmation Timeout)

-- 🛡️ Admin Lock Mechanism

-- 📜 Immutable Audit Trail

- All fund transitions are validated through a strict Finite State Machine (FSM).

- Branch Info:
```bash
main        → Base Stable Version
escrow-v2   → Hardened Escrow Production Version
```
